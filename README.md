# sharadar-dataset

For this project, I think the hardest part of the project was really understanding the data and trying extrapolate features from the data that was there. I’m not the most well versed with finances so there was a lot of research within that that was involved. I’m sure this is one of the largest challenges in feature engineering typically. But here are the features I came up with: </br></br>

Put/Call Ratio: </br>
	-extrapolated from Pull Units / Call Units</br>
	-Knowing put volume vs call volume can indicate market sentiment</br>
	-high ratio can mean time to sell, low time to buy</br></br>

Debt/equity ratio:</br>
	-extrapolated from Debt Holder value / Shareholder value </br>
	-company liabilities divided by shareholder equity</br>
	-helps evaluate company’s financial leverage</br>
	-high ratio can mean high risk</br></br>

Percent of Preferred units:</br>
	-extrapolated from Preferred Units/(Shareholder Units + Preferred Units)</br>
	-preferred units give additional rights, good to know what percent are preferred</br></br>

Percent of warrants:</br>
	-extrapolated from Warrants/(Shareholders Units + Preferred Units+ Warrant Units)</br>
	-rights to issue additional shares</br>
	-good to know how percentage of warrants that might become actual shares</br>
